# QuoteWall

**QuoteWall** is a place to store quotes for easy access, so you can remember them throughout your day. It is inspired by [Montaigne's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montaigne%27s_tower), where he covered the walls and ceilings in paintings and inscriptions.

# Usage
The structure is very lightweight, and enables users to add quotes individually or via an Excel document, and export their list of quotes as an array, Excel document, or to export an entire static HTML document version of their Quote Wall.
