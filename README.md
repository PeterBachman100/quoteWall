# QuoteWall

**QuoteWall** is a place to store quotes for easy access, so you can remember them throughout your day. It is inspired by [Montaigne's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montaigne%27s_tower), where he covered the walls and ceilings in paintings and inscriptions.

There are a few design elements to reduce habituation and help you remember to read these qoutes:
- The array is shuffled every time the page is refreshed.
- The colors alternately shift from light to dark.
- Random quotes are highlighted with varying chances and colors. Some only show up when the screen is dark and some only when it is light.

# Usage
The simplest usage is to download the file "quoteWallLocal.html" and save it to your documents. You can edit the array of quotes in the <head> of the document to customize your quote wall, and open the file locally.

There is also a github pages deployment where you can add quotes individually or via an Excel document, and export the list of quotes as an Excel document, or as an entire static HTML document version of the Quote Wall.
